      <p>The building’s fifth floor houses the company’s sparse office space, which sells a limited amount of posters at exorbitant prices. A normal 27-by-40 inch poster, which retails for less than $20 on Amazon, instead sells for $110 there.</p>

      <p>When asked for comment, an employee of the company refused to stay and answer questions about the business, instead choosing to leave the building via the parking lot. The employee said that the business hours were from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays, alluding to a settlement provision that required bona fide businesses to be open during normal business hours. Multiple trips to the office, however, have seen the office door locked in the afternoon with no response to knocking.</p>

      <p>The Sky Posters website features little additional information, as well as a history section pretty much cribbed word for word from the Wikipedia page for “poster.”</p>

      <p>Dennis Hathaway, the president of the Coalition to Ban Billboard Blight, said he’s been up to the location multiple times over the years and does not believe in the authenticity of the business.</p>

      <p>“In my view, it’s just a sham,” Hathaway said. “Quite frankly, he’s thumbing his nose at the city.”</p>

      <p>After his success in Westwood, McNeilly widened his scope aAfter his success in Westwood, McNeilly widened his scope across the city, posting supergraphic advertisements in more than a dozen sites across Los Angeles and picking up the profits.</p>

      <p>Carmen Trutanich, who succeeded Delgadillo as city attorney, took McNeilly and building management companies to court over the additional advertisements, which the city claimed were illegal.</p>

      <p>In a case of legal déjà vu, McNeilly tried to make a civil liberties case out of the matter, again posting giant pictures of the Statue of Liberty at the locations. The trouble was that several of those sites displayed images with commercial advertisements for movies, TV shows, automobiles and other products and services not too soon after.</p>

      <p>Hit with the preponderance of evidence, SkyTag, Inc., decided to settle with the city in 2013 by paying $1.2 million and removing the illegal images from 17 locations, including one on the opposite eastern wall of the Westwood Medical Plaza building.</p>

      <p>However, under the terms of the new settlement, the previous agreement with Delgadillo still stood, meaning that the west wall was left untouched by the legal decision. Since the case was settled “with prejudice,” the city is unable to bring the case back to court under the same charges, leaving the issue languishing in a kind of legal </p>

      <p>“That fine was just a slap on the wrist,” Hathaway said. “He’s an opportunist. He’s making money and he doesn’t care about the law.”</p>

      <p>In the 15 years since the original billboard fight, a lot has changed. Delgadillo was booted out of politics on the back of a number of controversies during his tenure as city attorney. Feuer, on the other hand, redeemed his 2001 defeat and entered the city attorney’s office in 2013, where he has been vocal about removing billboard blight.</p>

      <p>And chastened by his defeat, the formerly chatty McNeilly has mainly strayed away from the public eye, holed up in his Beverly Hills compound, which Zillow estimates to be worth more than $2.5 million. McNeilly refused to comment for this story after repeated requests.</p>

      <p>Finally, during the several weeks between this story’s conception and its publication, the little Sky Posters label has disappeared underneath a fresh layer of white paint, erasing the trail of our origin story.</p>

      <p>What has stayed constant throughout the years though are the colossal images overlooking the bumper-to-bumper traffic on Wilshire Boulevard, a literal illustration of the curvy and complicated story of a lone wall in Westwood.</p>

        <p>Westwood Community Council Chair Steve Sann sees McNeilly’s efforts a bit differently.</p>

        <p>“He’s not an artist – he’s a billboard businessman,” Sann said. “He’s a horrific perpetrator of supergraphics in the world and advertises billboards so large you can see them from space.”</p>

        <p>Sticking to his guns, McNeilly fought back against the charges, asserting his right to free expression of a noncommercial image. He later emerged victorious when a state appeals court sided with him and allowed the Statue of Liberty image to remain in place.</p>

        <p>At face level, this may sound like the story of an innocent citizen standing up to an oppressive governmental force.</p>

        <p>A letter sent to the Los Angeles Times a few months before McNeilly’s court victory, however, ended up being oddly prescient.</p>

        <p>“Who could complain about something as patriotic as the Lady? Should his claim be upheld, though, I can pretty much guarantee that his next mural won’t be of his mom holding an apple pie. It’ll be right back to the lucrative beer, jeans, cars, etc. I do hope the courts won’t be taken in by this man’s patently money-grubbing ploy,” wrote South Pasadena resident Mike Kvammen in response to a story about the mural in the paper.</p>

        <p>Kvammen turned out to be slightly wrong in his prediction. Instead of beer, jeans or cars, it was Japanese bombers screaming out at drivers on Wilshire Boulevard.</p>

        <p>Not long after the court upheld McNeilly’s right to the memorial sign, he changed it again, this time as an advertisement for the Ben Affleck flick, “Pearl Harbor.”</p>

        <p>Again, city officials ordered it be removed and threatened to hit McNeilly with fines or jail time if he refused.</p>

        <p>McNeilly and the building owners ended up capitulating, but a few months later, the events of 9/11 shocked the nation, and the wall in Westwood again became a symbolic battleground over liberty, law and public art. Following the attacks, McNeilly painted another mural on the wall featuring Lady Liberty and a firefighter in honor of the first responders.</p>

        <p>When it came to replacing David Berg, arguably the greatest closer in NCAA history, coach John Savage had options. Berg is the only reliever to have won Pac-12 Pitcher of the Year<q class=" collapsed" data-camayak-comment="Pitcher of the Year">, and he won it twice. He is also one of only three players to have earned All-Pac-12 honors four times.</q></p>
        <p>Savage said that redshirt freshman Nathan Hadley, sophomore Jake Bird and redshirt junior Tucker Forbes could all close games. Those three will pitch the sixth, seventh and eighth respectively, setting up for true freshman Brian Gadsby in the ninth.</p>
        <p>“We have guys with better stuff, bigger stuff, no question,” Savage said. “Gadsby&#8217;s just got kind of a winning pedigree. There&#8217;s something there. He kind of has some Berg mannerisms about him.”</p>
        <p><span class="s1">The main comparison between Berg and Gadsby is their delivery. They both throw fastballs, sliders and changeups from a low arm slot. Gadsby also features two more arm slots – three-quarters and low three-quarters – and throws all three of his pitches from all three slots. Berg, on the other hand, called himself a one-trick pony because he sticks to just the submarine slot.</span></p>
        <p>Berg will report to the Chicago Cubs minor league camp shortly,but he’s been spending time at Jackie Robinson Stadium in the meantime. Ever since Savage tagged Gadsby as the closer, Berg has taken an interest in his successor.</p>
        <p>“I told (Gadsby) right away, I’m obviously here to help,” Berg said. “I&#8217;ve been in all the moments that he wants to be in, so he&#8217;s doing the smart thing which is talking to somebody who&#8217;s been there and has done what he wants to do.”</p>
        <p><span class="s1">Gadsby says he’s texted Berg a few times to ask for advice, particularly in regards to the mental side of the game. Berg tells him to remain confident and remember that he’s been given the closer’s role for a reason.</span></p>
        <p><a href="http://dailybruin.com/2016/02/18/bruin-hitting-star-eric-filia-gets-second-chance-after-two-seasons-away/">BASEBALL: Outfielder Eric Filia gets second chance at stardom</a></p>
        <p><span class="s1">As part of the process in transitioning to that new role, Gadsby consulted sports psychologist Ken Ravizza. The Bruins hired Ravizza in 2010 and he&#8217;s worked with teams at the collegiate and major league level for more than 20 years.</span></p>
        <p>Ravizza and Gadsby met one-on-one to discuss ways the freshman can control the pressure and excitement of the ninth inning. Ravizza emphasized good breathing, following routines and making sure players have a focal point to visualize in order to calm down.</p>
        <p>“The athletes are more receptive than ever,” Ravizza said. “They want an edge, you know, and I think the mental game is one place where you can get it.”</p>
        <p>A crucial part of Gadsby&#8217;s mental game might not have even been developed on a baseball field. Savage called Gadsby a tremendous competitor, citing his success as a high school quarterback. Gadsby played four years of football at Crescenta Valley High School, throwing 40 touchdowns and winning a CIF championship in his senior year.</p>
        <p>&#8220;When you’re playing both sports, for the most part you&#8217;re almost always in season,” Gadsby said. “Football is such a competitive sport. It’s toughness. You’re going head to head. You can’t be soft or scared, especially being the quarterback.”</p>
        <p><b></b> Gadsby weighs 170 pounds, he&#8217;s 18 years old and he&#8217;s playing a premiere position on a team with a 235-pound Forbes and a 23-year-old Eric Filia. He&#8217;s unproven and untested. Nonetheless, he&#8217;s Savage&#8217;s guy for the final three outs.</p>
        <p>&#8220;I just think he has the mindset to close,&#8221; Savage said. &#8220;I hope I&#8217;m right, but that&#8217;s how we&#8217;re gonna start.&#8221;</p>

        <p>John Savage believes in second chances, but this decision wasn’t easy.</p>
        <p>“I went back and forth,” the UCLA baseball coach said. “I didn&#8217;t really ask other people&#8217;s opinion. I didn&#8217;t go that direction, I basically used my experience.”</p>
        <p>Night after night, Savage slept on it – running through the conversations he’d had with Eric Filia, considering whether the outfielder had learned from his mistake.</p>
        <p>Savage decided he had. He decided to let Filia back into the UCLA program.</p>
        <p>“I feel confident that he&#8217;s turned his life around,” Savage said. “He&#8217;s just more mature, he&#8217;s figured it out. He knows what&#8217;s at stake, as well. This is it, this could be his whole career.”</p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>There might have been more impactful players on the 2013 UCLA team that won the baseball program’s first national championship, but there was no bigger star than Eric Filia.</p>
        <p>Then a sophomore, Filia batted third and led the team with a .444 postseason average, driving in eight runs over five College World Series games to earn a spot on the All-CWS team.</p>
        <p>ESPN cameras repeatedly fixated on his then-girlfriend throughout the tournament, turning her into somewhat of an internet celebrity and even earning her modeling offers.</p>
        <p>Filia went 4-for-6 in the two games of the CWS final, adding a defensive gem in the first game when he tracked down a deep fly ball and hung on as he slammed into the right field wall.</p>
        <p>His success wasn’t exactly a surprise. The lefty had pummeled pitchers for years.</p>
        <p><a href="http://dailybruin.com/2016/02/18/freshman-closer-brian-gadsby-aims-to-fill-big-position/">BASEBALL: Freshman Brian Gadsby steps into shoes of legendary closer</a></p>
        <p>As a freshman on varsity at Edison High School in Huntington Beach, California, Filia hit an even .500 – tying a school record set by 2000 National League MVP Jeff Kent – and garnered team MVP honors as the everyday center fielder.</p>
        <p>It was not much longer until Filia was committed to the Bruins, telling the coaching staff that he wanted to be a part of the first UCLA team to win a national title. By the end of his sophomore season in Westwood, he had accomplished that goal.</p>
        <p>In the wake of the title-clinching game, in which Filia knocked in five of the Bruins’ eight runs, his career path seemed to be shaping up nicely. He would cement his rising prospect stock in the prestigious Cape Cod Baseball League that summer, return to Jackie Robinson Stadium to star for the Bruins the next spring and become a high pick in the 2014 MLB Draft.</p>

        <p>None of that happened.</p>
        <p>Filia went 1-for-15 on the Cape before heading home with an injury to his right shoulder. He performed physical therapy throughout the fall, but it didn&#8217;t prevent him from needing labrum surgery. He was sidelined for all of the 2014 season.</p>
        <p>That summer, instead of playing in a summer league, Filia took classes at UCLA. Toward the end of the summer, he was caught plagiarizing part of a philosophy paper.</p>
        <p>Filia was suspended from UCLA for the 2014-2015 school year and ruled ineligible for the 2015 season. From a baseball perspective, he had options: He could sign a free agent contract with a professional team or he could transfer to a National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics school and wait for the next draft.</p>
        <p>Instead, he moved back to Huntington Beach to live with his great-aunt and worked a couple jobs – one at a kite store on the pier and one at a car wash. He eventually landed a gig as an in-house butler at the Playboy Mansion, conversing with guests and cleaning up after parties.</p>
        <p>In light of his mistakes, Filia said he&#8217;s become very cognizant of his responsibility as a role model to his younger brothers, Michael and Bubba. He didn&#8217;t grow up with them – they lived in Irvine with his dad and stepmom, while he lived in Huntington Beach with his mom, grandma and great-aunt – but he saw them every other weekend.</p>
        <p>Filia wants each of them to develop into better ballplayers than he is, but more importantly, Filia said, he wants to convey the importance of school.</p>
        <p>So even after the academic suspension, Filia wanted to make sure he earned his degree from UCLA.</p>
        <p>In January, Filia approached Savage about returning to the program to play in 2016. The coach was unsure at first whether he could put his faith in Filia, who, even as he carried the Bruins in 2013, had never been Savage’s most trustworthy player.</p>
        <p>“He was kind of the funny guy, loose-cannon guy,” Savage said. “He&#8217;s kind of a white liar, a small liar.”</p>
        <p>Although Savage was surprised and disappointed by Filia’s academic misstep, he wasn’t shocked, he said.</p>
        <p>“He was walking a tightrope,” Savage said. &#8220;He was trending the wrong way, let&#8217;s put it that way.”</p>
        <p>Back in Savage’s office before the 2015 season started, Filia had to convince the coach he had matured.</p>
        <p>&#8220;I had to learn from it,” Filia said. “It really showed me who I had to be. &#8230; I just took it as, &#8216;Hey, get your head out of your butt.&#8217;”</p>
        <p>After plenty of deliberation, Savage decided that Filia had done that.</p>
        <p>“It&#8217;s a different presence about him, there&#8217;s a different trust factor,” Savage said. “He’s doing things right, all the little white lies are gone.”</p>
        <figure id="attachment_252285" class="thumbnail wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 200px"><a href="http://dailybruin.com/images/2016/02/web.sp_.baseballfeature.file_.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-252285"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-252285" src="http://dailybruin.com/images/2016/02/web.sp_.baseballfeature.file_-200x300.jpg" alt="web.sp.baseballfeature.file.jpg" width="200" height="300" data-uniq-id="642e7" /></a><figcaption class="caption wp-caption-text">Filia batted third and led the Bruins in hitting in 2013, when they won the first national championship in program history. (Daily Bruin file photo)</figcaption></figure>
        <p>The change in Filia goes beyond natural maturation, Savage said.</p>
        <p>“What happened had to happen, I think he needed a left and a right,” Savage said, pantomiming a punch with each hand.</p>
        <p>“We took something away from him that he values the most – other than, I’m sure, his family,” Savage said. “Baseball. Without baseball, this guy – I don’t know. This guy needs baseball.”</p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p>If Filia ever makes it to the big leagues – that’s his goal, and Savage thinks he can reach it – it will be because of his ability to hit.</p>
        <p>“He&#8217;s one of those guys that has a magical bat, so to speak,” said hitting coach Rex Peters. “One of those kids that can just get out of bed and hit.” In his first at-bat last summer for the Kenosha Kingfish of the Northwoods League – almost two years since his last at-bat – Filia roped the first pitch he saw into center field for a single. He went on to hit .340 for the Kingfish.</p>
        <p>“It felt like I never left,” Filia said. “Yeah, I was out of the game for two years but when I came back on the field, I just felt right.”</p>
        <p>He looks right, too, when he strides into a batter’s box.</p>
        <p>“When he steps in the box, you can tell he can hit, just by the way he steps in the box and the way he carries himself,” Peters said. “His confidence is very high. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a pitcher out there that he doesn&#8217;t think he can hit.”</p>
        <p>Peters said Filia has more natural hitting ability than all but two players he’s ever coached – one is major leaguer Daniel Descalso, the other a 10-year minor leaguer. Former Edison coach Steve Lambright said he&#8217;s never had a better hitter in his 23 years of coaching.</p>
        <p>&#8220;Right now, if you took a poll of all the area scouts in our area that are watching Filia, they&#8217;re seeing the same thing I am,&#8221; Savage said. &#8220;I mean, this dude can hit. This isn&#8217;t &#8216;Oh, he&#8217;s got a good swing.&#8217; No, this dude can <i>hit</i>.&#8221;</p>
        <p>College baseball has changed since Filia last played – the NCAA introduced new baseballs last year, pulling the sport out of a so-called dead-ball era and raising offensive statistics significantly.</p>
        <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to see some numbers from Filia – knock on wood – I think he&#8217;s going to catch a lot of people off guard,&#8221; Savage said. &#8220;I think he&#8217;s one of the best hitters in college baseball and people are going to find out this year.&#8221;</p>
        <p>Filia, who stands to benefit from the new offensive environment, has changed, too.</p>
        <p>Whereas the 2013 team saw Filia as a jokester, Savage said, the 2016 Bruins look up to him.</p>
        <p>“Even though he&#8217;s not labeled as a captain, his leadership qualities seem to be off the charts,” Savage said. “He&#8217;s a much better practice player, he plays harder. There&#8217;s no agendas. There&#8217;s no underlying fakeness to it. It&#8217;s legitimate.&#8221;</p>

    UCLA Baseball Team: Tucker Forbes

        <p>“There is no justification for such infringements on private, noncommercial speech,” said Dan Tokaji, a staff attorney with the ACLU of Southern California, in a statement at the time.</p>

        <p>City officials contended that McNeilly was trying to make his mark, except in a less artistic way – by opening up the Wilshire Corridor to profitable billboard advertising.</p>

        <p>The billboard industry is a force in LA politics to this very day, lobbying City Council for favorable regulation in the geographic center of the multibillion-dollar business. The efforts can be seen not too far away from UCLA, alongside the seedy glitz and glamour of the Sunset Strip.</p>

        <p>The industry’s influence was also evident in the 2001 race for city attorney, which had major consequences for the controversial wall in Westwood.</p>

        <p>On one side of the race was Feuer, who consistently stymied McNeilly and his efforts to get his work on the wall. Feuer was an attorney and politician who was known to rankle colleagues and special interest groups while acting as an outspoken advocate for West LA community members.</p>

        <p>On the other side was Rockard “Rocky” Delgadillo, a native of East Los Angeles and a football star at Harvard University. After returning to Los Angeles, he worked as an attorney at prominent law firms before being appointed as then-Mayor Richard Riordan’s deputy mayor for economic development.</p>

        <p>Going into the race, Feuer had the advantage of greater name recognition, but Delgadillo had a secret weapon up his sleeve, spurred on by a recent court decision that approved so-called “independent expenditures” in the race.</p>

        <p>This allowed businesses and special interest groups to contribute independently to campaigns if they followed a series of regulations, including not coordinating with the politicians beforehand.</p>

        <p>“I think it was one of the first campaigns where we started to see a high level of independent expenditures by companies,” said Jean Merl, a former Los Angeles Times reporter who covered the election.</p>

        <p>In his time on the city council, Feuer had made enemies of the billboard industry, consistently introducing new legislation to tamp down on what he considered to be blight on the Angeleno landscape.</p>

        <p>The major companies in the billboard industry decided to voice their displeasure toward Feuer to the tune of more than $400,000, an amount virtually unheard of at the time in a municipal election in the city. This staggering contribution came in the form of dozens of signs and billboards advertising Delgadillo across Los Angeles.</p>

        <p>“Clearly, the billboard companies didn’t like Mike Feuer,” Merl said. “He would be the last person they’d want as city attorney.”</p>

        <p>Sann put it a little more bluntly, accusing Delgadillo of being “owned and bought” by the billboard industry.</p>

        <p>Billboard companies blanketed the city with Delgadillo’s name and image, making the generally quiet race for city attorney into a massive public affair. Delgadillo emerged as the victor of the hard-fought runoff election with 52.4 percent of the vote.</p>

        <p>Soon after Delgadillo took office, City Council passed a ban on new “off-site” billboards, which are signs that direct to businesses at other locations. This kicked off a wave of lawsuits and litigation from sign companies wanting to assert their right to make money off billboard space.</p>

        <p>In his new role as city attorney, Delgadillo was able to craft legal agreements that proved profitable to the sign companies that supported him during his campaign.</p>

        <p>While the biggest media attention was focused on a 2006 settlement with Clear Channel to convert 400 of its billboards to more valuable digital billboards, a local example was on the humble west wall of the Westwood Medical Plaza building.</p>

        <p>One of these allegedly favorable settlements in 2003 ended a series of back-and-forth lawsuits between McNeilly, the building owners and the city over the right to advertise on the wall.</p>

        <p>“(Delgadillo) decided to sell Westwood down the river instead of aggressively fighting billboard blight,” Sann said.</p>

        <p>As part of the settlement, the building owners agreed to put a public service message for one month out of the year on the wall or pay the city the equivalent revenue. Industry professionals estimate the cost of the posters at up to $3,000 a day in the busy throughway.</p>

        <p>Additionally, the settlement gave the building owners the right to use the wall as a place for advertisements as long as it was solely used to promote “on-site” businesses.</p>

        <p>That gets us to the origin story of the little phrase.</p>

        <p>Under the terms of the settlement, only current tenants of the building with “bona fide office space” conducting “bona fide business” are allowed to place messages on the wall.</p>

        <p>This meant that while McNeilly and the building owners were given the right to put up new signs, they were also left with a problem. The Westwood Medical Plaza building is home to doctors’ offices, health stores, pharmacies and even an LA Fitness, but it doesn’t house a movie production studio or theater, which would be the legal way for the profitable movie advertisements to qualify as an on-site sign.</p>

        <p>So, McNeilly and the building owners decided to try something else. They set up a company in the building called Sky Posters, in effect creating an on-site business to legally justify the advertisements on the wall.</p>

        <br />
        <p>The building’s fifth floor houses the company’s sparse office space, which sells a limited amount of posters at exorbitant prices. A normal 27-by-40 inch poster, which retails for less than $20 on Amazon, instead sells for $110 there.</p>

        <p>When asked for comment, an employee of the company refused to stay and answer questions about the business, instead choosing to leave the building via the parking lot. The employee said that the business hours were from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays, alluding to a settlement provision that required bona fide businesses to be open during normal business hours. Multiple trips to the office, however, have seen the office door locked in the afternoon with no response to knocking.</p>

        <p>The Sky Posters website features little additional information, as well as a history section pretty much cribbed word for word from the Wikipedia page for “poster.”</p>

        <p>Dennis Hathaway, the president of the Coalition to Ban Billboard Blight, said he’s been up to the location multiple times over the years and does not believe in the authenticity of the business.</p>

        <p>“In my view, it’s just a sham,” Hathaway said. “Quite frankly, he’s thumbing his nose at the city.”</p>

        <p>After his success in Westwood, McNeilly widened his scope aAfter his success in Westwood, McNeilly widened his scope across the city, posting supergraphic advertisements in more than a dozen sites across Los Angeles and picking up the profits.</p>

        <p>Carmen Trutanich, who succeeded Delgadillo as city attorney, took McNeilly and building management companies to court over the additional advertisements, which the city claimed were illegal.</p>

        <p>In a case of legal déjà vu, McNeilly tried to make a civil liberties case out of the matter, again posting giant pictures of the Statue of Liberty at the locations. The trouble was that several of those sites displayed images with commercial advertisements for movies, TV shows, automobiles and other products and services not too soon after.</p>

        <p>Hit with the preponderance of evidence, SkyTag, Inc., decided to settle with the city in 2013 by paying $1.2 million and removing the illegal images from 17 locations, including one on the opposite eastern wall of the Westwood Medical Plaza building.</p>

        <p>However, under the terms of the new settlement, the previous agreement with Delgadillo still stood, meaning that the west wall was left untouched by the legal decision. Since the case was settled “with prejudice,” the city is unable to bring the case back to court under the same charges, leaving the issue languishing in a kind of legal </p>

        <p>“That fine was just a slap on the wrist,” Hathaway said. “He’s an opportunist. He’s making money and he doesn’t care about the law.”</p>

        <p>In the 15 years since the original billboard fight, a lot has changed. Delgadillo was booted out of politics on the back of a number of controversies during his tenure as city attorney. Feuer, on the other hand, redeemed his 2001 defeat and entered the city attorney’s office in 2013, where he has been vocal about removing billboard blight.</p>

        <p>And chastened by his defeat, the formerly chatty McNeilly has mainly strayed away from the public eye, holed up in his Beverly Hills compound, which Zillow estimates to be worth more than $2.5 million. McNeilly refused to comment for this story after repeated requests.</p>

        <p>Finally, during the several weeks between this story’s conception and its publication, the little Sky Posters label has disappeared underneath a fresh layer of white paint, erasing the trail of our origin story.</p>

        <p>What has stayed constant throughout the years though are the colossal images overlooking the bumper-to-bumper traffic on Wilshire Boulevard, a literal illustration of the curvy and complicated story of a lone wall in Westwood.</p>
